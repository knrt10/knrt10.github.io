> Practice touch typing and compete with your friends all from the comfort of your shell and become a typing ninja :boom:.

*But this has already been done. Why should I use this client?*

Because most other shell clients don't offer the features that we do

## Features

- Practice mode (offline mode)
- User stats (words per minute, time taken)
- Online mode (have a type-race by spawning up a server and sharing it with your friends)
- Ask for a rematch after the race ends (online mode)
- Can view the top 10 Highscores in online mode

## Installation

run `npm i --global typeracer-cli` from your command line

## Possible Errors

When you have installed this tool some times later you could find some error when you start **typerace**.

This may be because new update might have been rolled out and you have to update to latest version.

**How to update**

Its same as installation just run `npm i --global typeracer-cli` from your command line

Now even after that if you see any errors, follow the below steps

- find **.nvm** folder in your home directory.

-  cd to `.nvm/versions/node/${your node version}/bin` and delete **typerace file**
-  cd to `.nvm/versions/node/${your node version}/lib/node_modules` and delete **typeracer-cli folder**
- run `npm - -global typeracer-cli`

These steps should resolve the isssue. If it does not please open an isssue.

## Usage

run `typerace` or `typerace -h` to its usage

**Output**

```
Usage: typerace [options] [command]

  Options:

    -h, --help          output usage information

  Commands:

    practice|p          Start typeracer
    online|o [options]  Start game in online mode
```

**Practice mode**

- `typerace p` to start practice mode.

**Online mode**

 - `typerace o -f` to start online mode which will prompt a question

**Are you starting server for race (y/N) ?**

Now 2 cases are there

- If **yes**
  - You will share **Room to join for race**, **Number of racers**, **Number(sort of password)**
  - All the above will be prompted if you select yes and all of your friends should fill them out same.

- If **no**  
  - Ask for **Room to join for race**, **Number of racers**, **Number(sort of password)** from your friend who created a private room to race.

**Highscores**

To view the top 10 Highscores in online mode.

run `typerace o -s`

Enjoy :fire:

*But I don't know how to code, is there any other way I can contribute?*

Yes, ofcourse you can we need lots of paragraphs so that our users don't get bored by typing out the same text over and over  again. To add a paragraph follow these steps:

- Add paragraphs in `paragraphs/para.json`
- run `npm test`
- **Important:** all tests should pass as you would get a test failure for duplicate paragraphs.
- Find same paragraphs then run `npm test`
- If all tests pass locally then **Open a PR**
