This is just a simple demonstration to get a basic understanding of how kubernetes works while working step by step. I learnt kubernetes like this and made this repo to solve some problems that I faced during my learning experience so that it might help other beginners. We won't be going into depth about docker 😊 but will see sufficient content to get you basic understanding to learn and work with kubernetes. ✌️ Hope you enjoy learning. If you like it please give it a 🌟.

Important :- By seeing size of readme you might have second thoughts but to be honest if you work from start you won't experience any problem and learn along the way.
