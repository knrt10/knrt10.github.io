description: I am currently pursuing Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science
             from International Institute of Information Technology, Bhubaneswar. I am self taught Web and
             Android Developer with 2 years of experience. My love for web development started with HTML
             and CSS. Once I understood the language I started to build some advanced CSS projects and took a
             dive into bootstrap. I learned JavaScript, which helped me to understand the concept of web pages.
             After that I started learning Jquery and BackEnd Development. I did several projects in FreeCodeCamp
             and earned FrontEnd & Backend Developer Certificates. Along with that I also did projects which
             combined both FrontEnd and BackEnd development. You can find below the list of projects I have done so far.
             I started combining my knowledge of Web development in Android Applications and made one successfully.
             I am in love with golang right now and working to make cool awesome applications.
